Data Standards Hackathon for NGS based typing of HLA &amp; KIR

The goal of the hackathon is to:
* have implementers work to integrate a toolset with the various NGS systems and analysis software packages currently in use.

Hackathon attendees should be prepared to provide feedback on:
* how well the tools work together,
* how they work with extant NGS software and standards,
* elements that need fixing (and fix them),
* additional elements required to qualify as a MIBBI
